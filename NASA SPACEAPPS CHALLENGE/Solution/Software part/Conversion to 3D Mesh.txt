The Mars terrain, in which the player is spawned, is generated through actual astronomical data available on the pds geosciences website in HiRise DTM image files (like PSD IMG files).
We used a blender plugin, MGS Mola img Importer, a python script, which processes the .img files and converts them into a 3D mesh, which was then imported into the game engine and used as the terrain. The entirety of the planet could thus be generated to a great extent of accuracy. We are attatching some of the terrain mesh parts along with the documentation, though our future plans include having the entire planet's terrains uploaded on a server, and the simulator dynamically stitching terrain meshes through a script as the user explores the Red Planet without boundries.
