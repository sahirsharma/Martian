Integration of Arduino with Unreal Engine 4

We use the UE4duino pulgin for integrating the Hardware with Software component of the project.

The plugin had 4 Modes:
1. Open Serial
2. Write Serial
3. Read Serial
4. Close Serial

When the app starts:
*We use 'Open Serial' to start reading the Serail port connected over Bluetooth
*'Read Serial' enables the app to read user hardware inputs such as (Throttle and Joystick)
*'Write Serial' enables the app to provide a response to the Arduino, which is in this case is for haptic feedback
 actuation using vibration motors
* 'Stop Serial' enables the app to stop communication with the Arduino hardware(When we close the app
  OR when the app starts providing inappropiate Feedback)
